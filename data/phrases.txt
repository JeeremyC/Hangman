A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Bite the bullet
Break a leg
Call it a day
Cut somebody some slack
Cutting corners
Easy does it
Get out of hand
Get something out of your system
Get your act together
Give someone the benefit of the doubt
Go back to the drawing board
Hang in there
Hit the sack
Let someone off the hook
Make a long story short
Miss the boat
No pain no gain
On the ball
Pull yourself together
So far so good
Speak of the devil
The best of both worlds
To get bent out of shape
To make matters worse
Under the weather
Your guess is as good as mine
